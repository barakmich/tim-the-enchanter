It will occur to anyone who plays enough [Resistance](link) or [Avalon](link) that there's a great deal of probability afoot. If you've ever said "There's a 50/50 chance this team is bad!" you know what I'm talking about.

Lady of the Lake is a tool to track these games, build a Bayesian model of the situation as it stands, and, hopefully, deduce exactly what everyone's role is.
In the future, it may also turn into a full-blown AI.

Written in Python (fortunately thematic!) and using the fantastic pyMC toolkit.
